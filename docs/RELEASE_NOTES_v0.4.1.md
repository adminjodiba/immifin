## Summary

v0.4.1 completes the **IMMIFIN platform foundation**. This release establishes the subscription model, capability-based authorization, personal workspace, dashboard framework, profile management, premium feature gating, and the **Premium Feature Discovery** UX pattern — all documented and ready for **Design System 2.0**, the next major initiative.

No billing integration ships in this release. Stripe and real subscription storage remain future work.

## Major Features

### My Immifin workspace

- **My Immifin** top-level navigation dropdown — personal workspace distinct from Immigration, Finance, and Insurance modules
- Phase 1 menu: **Dashboard**, **Manage Profile**
- Pure navigation trigger (no direct navigation on click)

### Premium Feature Discovery

- **PremiumFeaturePreview** component — renders the real premium page underneath a blurred overlay

- Feature-specific benefit groups per premium page
- Close (X) dismisses overlay → educational Free-state info panel (Visa Bulletin History and Movement Tracker)

### Pricing foundation

- `/pricing` page with Free / Pro / Power plan cards
- Development Subscription Mode when `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_SUBSCRIPTION_MODE=true` (Sprint 5)

## Architecture

| Area | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| **Subscription tiers** | `lib/subscription/tiers.ts` — `free`, `pro`, `power` |
| **Capabilities** | `lib/subscription/capabilities.ts` — central tier→capability map |
| **Access checks** | `hasCapability(tier, key)` / `canAccess*(tier)` — not scattered plan-name checks |
| **Dev tier testing** | `?devTier=`, localStorage, DevTierSwitcher — development only |
| **Production default** | Users without enrolled tier default to **Free** |
| **Premium gating** | `PremiumFeaturePreview`, `ProFeatureGate`, `ProFeatureLockedState`, `DashboardAccessGate` |

See [BUSINESS_MODEL.md §12](./BUSINESS_MODEL.md#12-subscription-capability-architecture) and [SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md §14](./SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md#14-application-access-layer-subscription-capabilities).

| **Manual Tools** | Free |
| **Personalization & Automation** | Pro |
| **AI & Advanced Intelligence** | Power |

**Source of truth:** [BUSINESS_MODEL.md](./BUSINESS_MODEL.md) — all future feature gating decisions must reference this document.

### Capability matrix (summary)

| Capability | Free | Pro | Power |
|------------|------|-----|-------|
| Personal Dashboard | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Save Immigration Profile | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Visa Bulletin History | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

## UX

### Premium Feature Discovery (standard pattern)

All future premium features should follow this flow for Free users:

```
Real Pro page
    ↓
Blurred preview
    ↓
Premium overlay (value + feature-specific benefits + upgrade CTA)
    ↓ (optional: user clicks X)
Educational information state (no Pro access)
```

**Design intent:** Users should think *"I want those insights"* — not *"I hit another paywall."*

See [PRODUCT_VISION.md §20](./PRODUCT_VISION.md#20-premium-feature-discovery) and [BUSINESS_MODEL.md §15](./BUSINESS_MODEL.md#15-premium-feature-discovery).

### Profile UX

- In-app Clear Section confirmation modals
- Unsaved changes protection on Manage Profile exit
- Locked profile sections with consistent Pro upgrade messaging

### Dashboard UX

- Stable layout architecture — layout stable, content dynamic
- EB comparative timeline vs GC progress timeline rules documented
- Today's Focus + Action Center guidance model
